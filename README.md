## Setup lavender for AOSP-Quack based rom

* Download supported sources (LineageOS, Arrow, Sakura, etc...) (this source is suited best for TugaOS, you will have to modify it for other ROMs)
* Once this is downloaded, clone this repo to .repo/local_manifests then sync again
* Run . build/envsetup.sh
* Launch your build (lunch TugaOS_lavender-userdebug & mka bacon)

## Credits

* sdm660 devs for their work
